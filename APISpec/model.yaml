    description: Additional attributes about a piece of equipment designated as a Dump Truck. Historically, there was a perceived need to track a lot of informatiion about a dump truck, but in practice, few fields are being completed by users. Places for the attributes are being maintained, but the UI is prompting only for a couple of the fields, and only those fields are likely to be populated. Additional basic information about the attributes can be found on Wikipedia, BC-specific details on MOTI&#39;s CVSE website and www.bclaws.ca&#x2F;EPLibraries&#x2F;bclaws_new&#x2F;document&#x2F;ID&#x2F;freeside&#x2F;30_78#AppendicesAtoK, Appendix A and  B.
